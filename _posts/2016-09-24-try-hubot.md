I tried to use [hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) lately. Actually I knew this project months ago, but I can't figure out how to start it at that time. I tried it today, that's because I think it can be my personal assistant(It turn out to be not, maybe my usage is wrong).

I followed the [guide](https://hubot.github.com/docs/) to start. It's easy and clear(can't remember why I can't start months age).

But it's not good-looking when I am using shell adapter. So I change the adapter to [gitter2](https://github.com/huafu/hubot-gitter2). I kind of stucked at this step, because I missed [this](https://github.com/huafu/hubot-gitter2#troubleshooting) and used different name. Finally I created a new gitter account with my twitter and use to be the hubot. It work well with Gitter, I kind of like it when I can use it get random gif and images.

Actually it has so [many scripts](http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/) to enhance its power. But since [hubot-scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts) is **DEPRECATED**(I might have to copy all the scripts to my hubot?). I glanced over the catalog, it connect so many services on Internet. asana.coffee might be something I wanted, but I haven't tried it yet.

These scripts should be the power of hubot. In fact the connection(or the link) is also the essence of Internet.
