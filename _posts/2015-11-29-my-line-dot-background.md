Yesterday I build a page to use a canvas as background full of dots and lines. And the screenshot is something below:

![line-dot-background.gif](/images/line-dot-background.gif)

And I put it in my [github](https://github.com/ShallmentMo/line-dot-background).Feel free to use it or change it.

The most difficult part is cleaning the previous drawing. Thanks for the help come from stackoverflow, which let me know the composition of canvas.
